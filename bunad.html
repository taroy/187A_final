        <h2> Interviews </h2>

          <p>We wish to create an E-Zine about the Norwegian folk costume called bunad.
          In this part of the assignment we have defined three user groups and interviewed people
          that fits into these groups. We have also looked at other websites about the Norwegian folk
          costume that are similar to the one that we wish to develop in part 2 of this assignment.</p>
          <br>
          <b>Expert</b>
          
          <p>Our expert user is someone who knows a lot about the Norwegian national costume; bunad.
          The user is likely to own his/her own bunad, but that does not have to be the case.
          The expert user can also be a prospective buyer at the end of the process, or simply
          someone with a special interest in the Norwegian national costume. We believe that these
          users are likely to be interested in detailed information about bunads, or about specific
          bunads from specific regions of Norway.</p>
          <br>
          
          <b>Moderate</b>
          
          <p>Our moderate users have some knowledge about bunads. They may be owners of the national costume or
          someone that are thinking about getting one. The moderate users have some prior knowledge about the
          tradition and about bunads in general. We believe that this user group are likely to be interested in
          basic information about the bunads and their county of origin.    </p>
          <br>
            
          <b>Novice</b>
          
          <p>Our novice user knows little or nothing about bunads. They are likely to be foreigners or locals with
          minimal knowledge about the bunad and of the history of the Norwegian national costume. We believe that
          they are likely to be interested in general information about the tradition and will probably look at
          images of the costumes, rather than reading the details.</p>

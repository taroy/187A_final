        <h4>Experts</h4>
        <br>
        
        <p><b>Hanne</b></p>
        <p>Hanne owns a Romeriket bunad that her mom gave her for her Confirmation.
        She knows a lot about the bunad tradition. Her grandmother had a book about bunads
        and used to tell Hanne about them when Hanne was younger. Hanne also participated in a
        bunad parade as a kid. Some of her family friends are goldsmiths and make special bunad silver,
        so she got her silver from them. Hanne likes that you can always wear it in weddings, baptisms,
        the national day etc. And that she never has to worry about getting a dress. </p>
        
        <p><b>Kirsten</b><p>
        <p>Kirsten does not own a bunad and is not planning on buying one now, but she wishes she had one.
        She thinks bunads are very pretty and likes that you can use them over and over again.
        For Kirsten it's about tradition and origin and she finds it important to have a link to the bunad you own.
        Kirsten is concerned about preserving the heritage. She stated that a key issue is that they are handmade
        and not a mass produced. "It doesn't get more Norwegian than a bunad."</p>
        
        <p>She also has a lot of knowledge about the tradition in general. For example that there are different silver
        jewelry that belongs to the different bunads and that back in the days it was a distinction between everyday
        clothing and festive clothing.</p>
        
        <p>Kirsten has read about bunads online when she was looking for a bunad for her niece. The niece has family
        in three different parts of Norway, so Kirsten was comparing the various bunads to each other.
        She was looking at appearance, price and historical information about the bunads.</p>
        
        <p><b>Elin</b></p>
        <p>Elin owns a bunad from Nordland where she has family roots. It is important to her to have a
        bunad that is related to the origin of her family. She is very interested in the tradition and
        have read several books on the subject. Some years ago she looked up a bunad online.
        She considered sewing a Hallingdals bunad for one of her relatives and wanted to look closer at
        the details of that particular costume. The project were however postponed due to the high price. </p> 
        <br>
            
        <h4>Moderate</h4>
        <br>
        
        
        <p><b>Jens</b></p>
        <p>Jens does not own a bunad and are not planning on getting one. He thinks they are too warm, but he
        likes the way they look on others. Especially on women. He has never read about bunads online, but
        knows that they are Norways national costume based on regions and places in Norway, that it's a traditional
        festive clothing and elaborate handwork with special patterns and silver. Jens also knows that they are made
        of wool and are very hard to iron. </p>
        
        <p><b>Thomas</b><p>
        <p>Thomas does not own a bunad, but wants one. For now the expenses are too high, but he has already begun
        the process of deciding what kind of folk costume he wants. Thomas has been looking in a bunad encyclopedia
        and would be interested in searching the web as well. He is concerned with how the bunad looks and has so far
        focused on the images. He has been looking at all kinds of bunads, but admits that he will choose one from a
        place where he has relatives.</p>
        
        <p><b>Elin Hasas</b></p>
        <p>Elin is owner of a bunad from Vestfold, the part of Norway where she is born and raised. She inherited it
        from her mother when she was 14 years old and went through the sacrament of Confirmation. Elin has never
        looked at bunads online, but if she were to do it she would be looking for accessorize for the Vestfold
        bunad that she owns. Elin has some knowledge about the tradition, for example that girls are not supposed
        to wear a silver belt before they get married, but she would love to learn more about how the tradition started.</p> 
        <br>
            
        <h4>Novice</h4>
        <br>
        
        <p><b>Anders</b><p>
        <p>Anders does not own a bunad, but would like one if he looked good in it. He thinks bunads are very classy
        and nice, but that they seem kind of unpractical because they are so heavy and warm. He knows that there
        are many different bunads from different counties of Norway, that they are made of wool and have lots of
        silver, and some have special headgear and shoes. Anders has not looked at bunads online and would rather
        not sew one himself. "That would take way too much time."</p>
        
       <p><b> Maren</b><p>
        <p>Maren does not have a bunad, but she is starting to want one. She has never looked at a bunad online,
        but if she were to do so she would look at quality, price and where she could buy it. Maren thinks it is
        important to get a bunad from a place where she feels that she belongs or where she has family.
        She would rather want a medium nice looking bunad from a place where she belongs, than a more beautiful
        bunad from a place that she does not have any connections. </p>
        
        <p><b>Corey</b><p>
        <p>Corey is born and raised in the United States. When we asked him about the Norwegian folk costume bunad
        he had never heard of it before. Further we asked him what he would want to know about it now that he
        knows that such a traditional costume exists. Corey was most curious about how it looks and on what occasions
        Norwegians use it. He would like to go online to learn more about it. </p>
        <br>
            
        <h4>Interview Results</h4>
        
        <p>After interviewing all the expert, moderate and novice users we found that the information they gave
        was as expected. The expert users all had a bunad or wished that they did. They had a lot of knowledge
        about bunads and were genuinely interested in its history and tradition. The moderate users either had
        a bunad, wanted a bunad or didn't want a bunad. All of them had general knowledge about bunads like many
        norwegians do. The novice users didn't own a bunad and they had some or no knowledge about them. We found
        that most of the users like bunads and thinks that it is important that the owner of a bunad has a
        connection to the place the bunad is from.</p>

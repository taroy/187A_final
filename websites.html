        <p>This site gives a good overview of the tradition and history that is related to the Norwegian folk costume.
        It has a categorization of images that are based on the bunads place of belonging. We want to use a categorization
        like this, but we wish to narrow it down even more.

        <p>Husfliden is an association that is well known in Norway for making bunads. They have been working with bunads
        since 1891 and contributed to their development in over 100 years. The Norwegian folk costume is a traditional garment
        that has to be sewn in a specific way and husfliden is the 'go to' for Norwegians looking for bunads. This site has an
        overview over the various bunads and the location in Norway that the particular bunads represent. Husfliden is a
        trustworthy source of information that we will be using actively when filling our E-zine with content.

        <p>This site was created by a foreign and is meant for foreigners. It is useful for us to get insight into what
        information this type of users may want. The site does not show off the diversity of bunads, but the once that are
        showed have additional information connected to them. We wish to present text and images in a similar way.

        <p> <a href="http://www.lailas.net/bunads/index.htm">www.lailas.net/bunads</a> </p>

        <p>This site does a good job of categorizing the different bunads by place of origin. At the top level they are
        categorized by county. At the second level the bunads are categorized further into smaller areas within the county.
        The information pages have pictures with related text in addition to a more general text about the bunad type. We like
        how the categorization is done and wish to steal from it.

        <p>Daughters of Norway is an organization for women who wish to preserve their Norwegian heritage. On their website
        they have a section about clothing and the Norwegian folk costume bunad. This site is useful to us because the users are
        not necessarily born and raised in Norway. It gives us some idea about what information foreign users with Norwegian
        heritage may be interested in. However, the information is badly structured and can be hard to find in the chaos of links.
        The site has images of members in bunad, but not all of the images has captions with additional information about the
        bunad's county of belonging.
